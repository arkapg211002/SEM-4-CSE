    generic(
        DATA_WIDTH : integer := 8; -- The width of the data bus
        ADDR_WIDTH : integer := 10 -- The width of the address bus
    );
    port(
        clk : in std_logic; -- The clock input
        we : in std_logic; -- The write enable input
        addr : in std_logic_vector(ADDR_WIDTH - 1 downto 0); -- The address input
        din : in std_logic_vector(DATA_WIDTH - 1 downto 0); -- The data input
        dout : out std_logic_vector(DATA_WIDTH - 1 downto 0) -- The data output
    );
end RAM;

```
The code above declares an entity RAM. The entity has two generic parameters DATA_WIDTH and ADDR_WIDTH which define the width of the data and address buses respectively. The entity also has five ports: clk, we, addr, din, and dout. The clk port is the clock input, we is the write enable input, addr is the address input, din is the data input, and dout is the data output.

```vhdl
architecture Behavioral of RAM is

type memory_array is array (0 to 2**ADDR_WIDTH-1) of std_logic_vector(DATA_WIDTH-1 downto 0); 
-- declare memory array with size based on address width and data width

signal mem : memory_array := (others => (others => '0')); 
-- initialize memory array with default value of '0'

function conv_integer(v : std_logic_vector) return integer is
    begin
        return to_integer(unsigned(v));
end conv_integer;
-- The conv_integer() function is used in the RAM module process to convert 
--the addr signal from a std_logic_vector to an integer value. 
--The integer value is then used to index into the memory array to read or write data.

begin

process(clk)
    begin
        if rising_edge(clk) then -- check for positive edge of clock
            if we = '1' then -- check for write enable signal
                mem(conv_integer(addr)) <= din; 
					 -- store the input data to the memory location specified by address
            end if;
            dout <= mem(conv_integer(addr)); 
				-- output the data stored at the memory location specified by address
        end if;
end process;

end Behavioral;

```
The code above declares an architecture named Behavioral for the RAM entity.

The architecture defines a type memory_array that represents a memory array with dimensions (0 to 2**ADDR_WIDTH-1) and DATA_WIDTH bits for each memory location.

The architecture also declares a signal named mem, which is an instance of the memory_array type. The mem signal is initialized to all zeroes using the others keyword.

The architecture defines a function named conv_integer that takes a std_logic_vector argument and returns an integer value. This function is used in the RAM module process to convert the addr signal from a `std_logic_vector

# Testbench Code Explanation

The tb_ram entity is defined as an empty entity with no ports. This is because the testbench is not a module that needs to be instantiated anywhere, but rather a separate code that will stimulate and test the functionality of the RAM module.

The architecture behavior of the testbench defines the signals that will be used as inputs and outputs to the RAM module, and how these signals will be generated and manipulated during the simulation.

The RAM module is defined as a component with inputs and outputs that match the ports of the RAM module that we are testing. This is necessary to instantiate the RAM module within the testbench and connect its ports to the signals generated within the testbench.

The clk, we, addr, and din signals are defined as inputs to the testbench, while dout is defined as an output. The clk signal is a clock signal with a period of 2 ps, and is generated by a clock process within the testbench.

The stim_proc process is responsible for generating the stimuli that will test the RAM module. Within this process, we perform two write operations to the RAM module by setting the din signal to x"AA" and x"55", and the addr signal to "0000000000" and "0000000100", respectively. We assert that the data read from the RAM module matches the expected output after each write operation by using an assert statement.

The wait statements that follow each write operation and read operation ensure that enough time is given for the data to be written to and read from the RAM module before we compare the data with the expected output.

In summary, the testbench code simulates the behavior of the RAM module by generating stimuli and testing the outputs of the RAM module against expected values. The assert statements in the testbench ensure that the behavior of the RAM module matches our expectations.
In VHDL, x denotes a hexadecimal (base 16) number. AA and 55 are both hexadecimal numbers.

In the context of the RAM testbench code, x"AA" and x"55" are used to represent data that is being written to and read from the RAM.

x"AA" represents the binary value 10101010. This data is being written to the memory location at address 0000000000.

x"55" represents the binary value 01010101. This data is being written to the memory location at address 0000000100.

When the RAM module reads from these memory locations, it should output the same data that was written to them. The testbench uses assert statements to check whether the expected data is being output by the RAM module. If the output data is incorrect, the testbench reports an error.

The assert statement is a construct in VHDL used to check for a certain condition and report an error if that condition is not met during simulation. In the testbench code provided, the assert statements are used to check that the data read from the RAM is the same as the data written to it, and to report an error if they do not match.

Here is the syntax of the assert statement in VHDL:
```vhdl
assert condition
  report message
  severity severity_level;

```
-> condition is a Boolean expression that is evaluated during simulation. If it is false, the assertion fails and an error is reported. </br>
-> message is a string that describes the error message that will be displayed if the assertion fails. </br>
-> severity_level is an enumeration type that specifies the severity level of the error. It can be one of note, warning, error, or failure. </br>

## IEEE.NUMERIC_STD.ALL
ieee.numeric_std.all is a library that provides standard numeric data types and arithmetic operations in VHDL. It defines signed and unsigned types that can be used to represent binary numbers of a specific bit width, and provides functions for arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
The use of ieee.numeric_std.all is recommended over other numeric libraries because it provides standard and portable arithmetic operations, making the code more reusable and easier to maintain. It also includes a range of predefined functions and operators that can be used to perform complex arithmetic operations.

## Questions and Answers
Q. What is the difference between a volatile and non-volatile memory? Which type of memory is commonly used in computer RAM?

Answer: A volatile memory loses its data when the power is turned off, whereas a non-volatile memory retains its data even when the power is turned off. Computer RAM uses volatile memory.</br>

Q. Can a memory module be too fast for a processor? Explain your answer.

Answer: Yes, a memory module can be too fast for a processor. If the memory module is significantly faster than the processor, the processor may not be able to process data as quickly as it is being delivered from the memory module. This can cause the processor to stall, which reduces overall system performance.</br>

Q. Explain the concept of pipelining in memory modules. How can it improve the performance of a memory module?

Answer: Pipelining in memory modules involves breaking up the process of reading or writing data into smaller stages or phases. Each stage is completed separately, and the output of one stage is fed directly into the input of the next stage. This can improve the performance of a memory module by allowing multiple memory operations to be in progress simultaneously.</br>

Q. What is a memory controller? What functions does it perform in a computer system?

Answer: A memory controller is a hardware component that manages the flow of data between the processor and the memory modules. It performs several important functions, including managing the timing and sequencing of memory operations, controlling the flow of data between the processor and memory, and buffering data to ensure smooth operation.</br>

Q. How can a computer system support more memory than the processor's address bus can accommodate? Explain the concept of virtual memory.

Answer: A computer system can support more memory than the processor's address bus can accommodate by using the concept of virtual memory. Virtual memory involves using a portion of the hard disk as an extension of the main memory. When the processor requests data from memory that is not currently in physical memory, the memory controller retrieves the required data from the hard disk and stores it in physical memory for processing by the processor.

Q: What is the maximum amount of data that can be stored in the RAM you have designed?
A: The RAM can store up to 2^10 = 1024 bytes of data since it has a 10-bit address bus.

Q: Can you explain how you implemented the write enable signal for your RAM design?
A: The write enable signal is implemented using an AND gate where one input is the input WE signal and the other input is the output of a decoder that checks if the address input is within the range of valid addresses. This ensures that the RAM can only be written to at valid addresses.

Q: What is the purpose of using a testbench in the design process?
A: The purpose of a testbench is to verify that the design is working as intended by providing stimuli to the design and observing its outputs. This allows for debugging and validation of the design before implementation.

Q: Can you explain what a clock period is and how it affects the operation of your RAM design?
A: The clock period is the duration between two successive clock pulses. In the case of the RAM design, it affects the timing of the read and write operations as these operations are synchronized with the clock signal. A shorter clock period would mean that the RAM can perform read/write operations more frequently, but it also requires faster circuitry and may result in more power consumption.

Q: How does the RAM design ensure that it can store only 8-bit values at each memory location?
A: The RAM design ensures that only 8-bit values can be stored at each memory location by using an 8-bit data input signal and an 8-bit data output signal. Additionally, the data is stored in a register that is connected to the memory array, which ensures that only 8 bits are stored at each memory location. Finally, the output signal is also 8 bits wide, ensuring that only 8 bits are read from each memory location.
